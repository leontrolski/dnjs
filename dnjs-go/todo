- will two lines of comments work?
- use backticks more with the literal assertions
- CapitalCase everything public (Eof, Literal etc)
- template parser logic feels a bit brittle
- flip all assertions
- what do I provide as an interface?
- render() for a server
- add x["foo"]
- make undefined a better value
- get toString and === formalised
- use type switch not Kind everywhere
-test m() with empyt class list

Thoughts on go:
- best bit is the mutation and reference bit, noone seems to mention this
- worst bit is how nil doesn't seem to fit in the type system properly, that and the if err != nil noise
